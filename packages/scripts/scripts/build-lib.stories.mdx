## build-lib

These uses babel to build the contents of the src into `project/lib`. Note that libs are not processed with webpack.

### Exporting files from an application

We can use build-lib to export part of an application for usage as a preview in a settings application via npm package publishing.

To enable this, add a `./.tablecheckrc.json` file with the following;

```json
{
  "isAppWithExports": true
}
```

Then in your `package.json` file add as entry key pointing to your exports file, eg `"entry": "./src/exports.ts"`.

With this setup running `npx tablecheck-scripts build-lib` will create a lib folder targeting the exports file.

Note that a restriction of the rollup process is that static assets (svg, png, etc) cannot be built into the package export.
