## Introduction

This repository contains all the scripts and settings required for use by our react projects.
It is largely inspired from Facebook's [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) system but doesn't support the "eject" functionality.

See the table of contents for more details on each package.

### Local dev suggestions

- If you need to update any of the packages in this repository, you can test those changes first in the `/node_modules/package/src/file` folder of the app. For example, if you need to change styleguidist in Tablekit, you would do those changes first in `tablekit/node_modules/@tablecheck/styleguidist/src/file`. Once everything looks good, you can copy those changes into this codebase
