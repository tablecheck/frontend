## start-sspa

This command is used to start a "child" [Single SPA](https://single-spa.js.org/) node.

For a "parent" SSPA, use the `spa` config and commands.

The main export file should conform to the [Parcels API](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/parcels-api),
usually for us that means using [single-spa-react](https://single-spa.js.org/docs/ecosystem-react/) as the projects main `index.jsx` file.

### Deprecated

Use `razzle start` directly instead, this command aliases the razzle one but doesn't pass any arguments.

If you haven't setup the razzle config using the init command, create one of the following `razzle.config.js` file in the root of your folder.

```js static
module.exports = require('@tablecheck/scripts/razzle/sspa');
```

## Upgrade Notes

The old `PUBLIC_URL` variable needs to be renamed to `PUBLIC_PATH` to continue working correctly.
