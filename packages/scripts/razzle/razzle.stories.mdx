# Razzle

## Basic Usage

```js
// razzle.config.js
// use one of the following as appropriate
module.exports = require('@tablecheck/scripts/razzle/sspa');
module.exports = require('@tablecheck/scripts/razzle/spa');
module.exports = require('@tablecheck/scripts/razzle/ssr');
```

## SPA and SSPA options/arguments

There are two CLI arguments that can be used when extending the `sspa` or `spa` razzle configs.

| Command             | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--standalone` `-s` | This command will use `/src/client.standalone.tsx` as the entry instead of `/src/client.tsx`. Mostly used in SSPA child applications. |
| `--staticJsEntry`   | This option will remove the hash/fingerprint on the main client.js file when building for production.                                 |

`--staticJsEntry` can also be provided in the razzle config by extending the spa/sspa configs.

```js
const baseConfig = require('@tablecheck/scripts/razzle/sspa');

module.exports = baseConfig.extend({
  options: {
    staticJsEntry: true
  }
});
```

## Bundled Plugins

The following plugins are enabled and running by default when extending any of the razzle setup files.

- moment-locales-webpack-plugin, see https://momentjs.com/docs/#/use-it/webpack/ for how to load secondary languages
- react-dev-tools for safari, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/20095
- with `BUNDLE_ANALYZER=true` or on builds, a bundle analysis output is generated

## Extending configs

There are two recommended ways to extend razzle functionality.

### Setup Files

For modifying the webpack config use setup files. In a project root `/razzle` folder, create as many files as you want using the following template.

```js
module.exports = function modifyWebpackConfig(...) {
  // for arguments and usage see https://razzlejs.org/docs/customization#extending-webpack
  // this function can be used identically to the official one
}
```

### Extending Configs

We also support dynamically extending any of the bundled configs at the top. This is the least recommended way as it's the most likely to cause issues.
For examples of this see the config files in this folder.
