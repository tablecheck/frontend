## precommit

This will run three processes on all _staged_ .js files. (there are issues that prevent us running this on json and md files)

If you do not want to run check-config then pass `--no-config` along with the command. Like used in this package.

1.  Run prettier to auto format code.
2.  Run eslint to check other code points are fixed.
3.  check-config, this will check the setup of your config files to ensure that keys are setup correctly across each environment.
