## test

This command will run the jest test suite against all `*.(test|spec).[tj]sx?` files.

## Reports

By default, the test will output both a coverage folder, standard console.log output and a junit folder.

The junit report can be used in gitlab as outlined [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/unit_test_reports.html#how-to-set-it-up).

```yaml
test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test
  artifacts:
    when: always
    paths:
      - junit/**/*.xml
    reports:
      junit: junit/**/*.xml
```

Or in GitHub actions by using the following step definitions.

```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  run: npm test

- name: Publish Unit Test Results
  uses: EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action@v1
  if: always()
  with:
    files: junit/**/*.xml
```
