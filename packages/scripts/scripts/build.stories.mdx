## build

### Deprecated

Use `razzle build` directly instead, this command aliases the razzle one but doesn't pass any arguments.

This builds an SPA javascript application into the `project/build` folder. See [start](#section-start) for more details.

## Upgrade Notes

The old `PUBLIC_URL` variable needs to be renamed to `PUBLIC_PATH` to continue working correctly.
