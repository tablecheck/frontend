## lint

This command will check all code for formatting and convention errors.
Internally it uses typescript, eslint, checks prettier format and finally validates that the package.json file doesn't have any loose dependencies.
For eslint rules see the eslint-config package. Can be overriden by normal config files but generally should not be.

### Command Options

The following extra commands are available;

- **`--fix`:** Automatically fix all correctable issues including prettier, configs and packages.json
- **`--skip-typescript`:** Skip typescript checking
- **`--package`:** Provide a package for running only one package in a lerna monorepo, only applies to typescript and eslint checks
- **`sequential`:** Run eslint on each package sequentially, this is mostly useful for when a particular projects types crash eslint.
