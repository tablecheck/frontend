## start

### Deprecated

Use `razzle start` directly instead, this command aliases the razzle one but doesn't pass any arguments.

If you haven't setup the razzle config using the init command, create one of the following `razzle.config.js` file in the root of your folder.

## Upgrade Notes

The old `PUBLIC_URL` variable needs to be renamed to `PUBLIC_PATH` to continue working correctly in SPA applications

### For Single Page Applications (like create-react-app)

```js static
module.exports = require('@tablecheck/scripts/razzle/spa');
```

### For Server Side Rendered Applications

```js static
module.exports = require('@tablecheck/scripts/razzle/ssr');
```
