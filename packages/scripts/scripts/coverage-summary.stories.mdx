## coverage-summary

This script is used to output a format compatible with [GitLab runners coverage summary](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#test-coverage-parsing) from the output of the [test](#section-test) script.
It expects the jest generated (from istanbul) `./coverage/coverage-summary.json` file to exist.
