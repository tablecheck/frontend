## init

To init a package, simply run the following command in an empty directory.

```shell
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
npx --legacy-peer-deps -p @tablecheck/scripts tablecheck-scripts init
```

## Using init to upgrade existing projects

If you have a project using an older version of our tooling you can attempt to shortcut the upgrade process by simply running the init command again.
Note that you do need the `@latest` or the current version of scripts in your folder will be used instead of the newest one.
This is not a perfect upgrade and is likely to break all your code, it's recommended to carefully check the git diff and revert any unwanted changes afterwards.

```shell
npx --legacy-peer-deps -p @tablecheck/scripts@latest tablecheck-scripts init
```
