## build-sspa

### Deprecated

Use `razzle build` directly instead, this command aliases the razzle one but doesn't pass any arguments.

This script builds a "child" SSPA project into the 'project/build' folder. See [start-sspa](#section-start-sspa)

## Upgrade Notes

The old `PUBLIC_URL` variable needs to be renamed to `PUBLIC_PATH` to continue working correctly.
